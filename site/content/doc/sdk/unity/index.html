<h2>Unity SDK</h2>

<p>You can get the lastest version of the library by downloading it from <a href="http://github.com/whiteshoemedia/liftpass-unity-sdk/">Github</a> and copying it into your project.

<h3>Initiating Liftpass</h3>

<p>To start receiving prices from Liftpass, you must first initialize the Unity SDK with your application key and secret. This can be found either by doing an API request or using the dashboard. Additionally you must specify the server and port the Liftpass server runs from.</p>

<p>Import the Liftpass related Unity source code and call <code>Init(applicationKey, applicationSecret, liftpassServer, liftpassPort, defaultPricesDataPath)</code> with your application credentials. You are now ready to start recording and receiving price updates.</p>

{% highlight 'csharp' %}

Liftpass.Instance.Init(ApplicationKey, ApplicationSecret, LiftpassServer, LiftpassPort,  DefaultPrices);

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Getting virtual good prices and IAP rewards</h3>

Prices for virtual goods and the rewards for IAP are received at the time that the Liftpass SDK sends analytics back to the server. This process is initiated with the <code>sync</code> function. 

{% highlight 'csharp' %}
Liftpass.Instance.Sync();
{% endhighlight %}

Once the SDK has completed the <code>sync</code> function you can start looking up prices for virtual goods and rewards for the IAP. 

{% highlight 'csharp' %}
// For virtual goods use the function getPrice
LiftpassCurrency virtualGoodPrice = Liftpass.Instance.GetPrice(NameOfVirtualGood);

// For IAP use the function getReward
LiftpassCurrency iapReward = Liftpass.Instance.GetReward(NameOfIAP);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The price/reward is stored in the <code>LiftpassCurrency</code> object which contains eight variable representing the 8 possible currencies Liftpass can support. More information about managing and using Liftpass's currency model can be found in the <a href="/doc/content/">Content Management</a> page.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	If the virtual good or IAP is not found the result of <code>GetPrice()</code> and <code>GetReward()</code> will be <code>null</code>. You can also check wether there is a price/reward for a good using the function <code>HasPricesForGood()</code> and <code>HasRewardForGood()</code> respectively.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
	Prices and rewards are cached by the SDK so that even without Internet access prices will still be served to the user. Additionally the developer can package the application with a list of static prices to be used in the event that no Liftpass update is received.
</div>

<h3>Recording purchases</h3>

<p>When the user makes a virtual good purchase the Liftpass SDK must be notified of the transaction.</p>

{% highlight 'csharp' %}
Liftpass.Instance.GetReward(NameOfVirtualGood);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Similarly when the user makes an IAP purchase and the receipt has been verified by a third-party, the purchase must be recorded by the Liftpass SDK.</p>

{% highlight 'csharp' %}
Liftpass.Instance.RecordIAPPurchase(NameOfIAP, product.price, product.currency);
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Recording progress</h3>

<p>The SDK can manage and track up to 32 unique progress metrics divided into 8 string based metrics and 24 numeric metrics. More information on how to use Liftpass' metric model can be found in the <a href="/doc/content/">Content Management</a> page.</p>

{% highlight 'csharp' %}

public static int RoundsWonMetric = 12;

// Updating a numeric metric
Liftpass.Instance.UpdateNumberMetric(RoundsWonMetric, roundsWon);
// Or more shorter version 
Liftpass.Instance.IncrementNumberMetric(RoundsWonMetric);

public static int PlayerColorMetric = 3;

// Updating a string metric
Liftpass.Instance.UpdateStringMetric(PlayerColorMetric, "blue");
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The index of each metric reflect those configured in the Liftpass server using either the API or dashboard.</p>

<h3>Pipes</h3>

<p>The Liftpass SDK can track automatically several kinds of progress metrics. Once you configure the application and allocate the location of progress metric they can be configured in the application code using "pipes". Pipes will automatically update certain progress metrics for you.</p>

{% highlight 'csharp' %}
public static int SessionCountMetric = 16;

// Configure pipe - every time the number of sessions increases, metric LiftpassSessionsCount will automatically update
Liftpass.Instance.SetNumberPipe(LiftpassSessionsCount, SessionCountMetric);

public static int LanguageMetric = 4;

// The device language will now be recorded as the 6th metric
Liftpass.Instance.SetStringPipe(LiftpassLanguageMetric, LanguageMetric);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Liftpass comes with a large collection of built-in pipes, not all are useful for all applications and so it is up to the developer to choose which make sense. </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>LiftpassOSVersionMetric</strong>: The version of the operating system.</li>
	<li><strong>LiftpassSessionsCountMetric</strong>: The number of sessions the application has had.</li>
	<li><strong>LiftpassTotalVirtualPurchasesMetric</strong>: The number of virtual goods the user has purchased.</li>
	<li><strong>LiftpassTotalIAPPurchasesMetric</strong>: The number of in-app purchases the user has purchased.</li>
	<li><strong>LiftpassTimezoneMetric</strong>: The timezone of the user as configured on the device (ex. -600 for EST).</li>
	<li><strong>LiftpassTotalPlayTimeMetric</strong>: Total number of seconds the application has been open for.</li>
	<li><strong>LiftpassDeviceModelMetric</strong>: The model of the device the application is running on.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	For pipes to work correctly they should be defined at the very beginning of the application launching procedure, right after <code>init(..)</code> is called.
</div>
